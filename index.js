          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Global Scope/ Window Binding identifies 'this' as an implied value based on the availble global resources, or as undefined if strict (mode).

    2. Implicit Binding works like a method in that it will bind and reference whatever is to the left of the dot (this.).

    3. Explicit Binding utilizes the .call, .apply, and .bind methods to direct object reference and creation as well as argument passing. Each method here has it's own 
    specific utility.

    4. New Binding uses the "new" keyword to reference a new object (made by prototyping) at the point it is invoked.
